				<h3>Certified Ethical Hacker v10</h3>
				<img src="images/CEA-logo.gif" />
				<p>In September 2018 I took and passed the Certified Ethical Hacker exam.  It is a test that is centered around ethical hacking, more specifically penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. I took a class centered around CEH where we practice real world penetration testing techniques on a set of virtual machines.

				<h3>Vulnerable Web App</h3>
				<p>I created this sample web application for a class offered at NDSU centered around Ethical Hacking.  The point of it is to be used as a lab assignment where students are supposed to try to find web application vulnerability.  This specific application is susceptable to both SQL Injection and XSS attacks. [<a href="https://github.com/steven-karschnia/Vulnerable-Web-App">Link</a>]</p>
