				<h2>Work Experience</h2>
				<p><strong>Smiths Medical,</strong> Minneapolis, MN <span style="float:right;">June 2020 - August 2020</span>
					<br />
					<i>Product Security Intern, R&amp;D</i>
					<br />
					The Product Security Team at Smiths Medical focused on finding, testing, and responding to
					potential vulnerabilities in their medical devices and the Off the Shelf software running on their devices.
					My focus was on writing exploits for known vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities with CVEs assigned,
					and testing the medical devices for those vulnerabilities.  I also created an automated vulnerability
					search tool that found any knew or updated CVE for the software running on the devices.  Some of my time
					was spent doing "Hardware Hacking", taking apart the device and trying to use the hardware to gain access.
					<ul>
						<li>Gained experience in writing exploits from scratch based on CVE description and other vendor responses.</li>
						<li>Learned more about how the hardware of a device can be used to gather information and gain access.</li>
					</ul>
					<br />
					<strong>Wipfli LLP,</strong> Minneapolis, MN <span style="float:right;">June 2019 - August 2019</span>
					<br />
					<i>Intern, Cyber Security Consulting</i>
					<br />
					At Wipfli, I worked on the Cyber Security Consulting Team which did penetration testing, vulnerability assessments,
					social engineering.  My main work was done in vulnerability assessment and phishing campaigns but I also helped with
					a few external and internal penetration tests.  On the penetration tests I helped with, most of my work was done in
					reconnaissence and information gathering as well as watching and learning the techniques used by my co-workers.
					For vulnerability assessments, I would run a scan through Nessus and then generate a report and then filter that report
					before sending it to the client for review.  The phishing campaigns I worked on I created realistic looking emails and
					landing pages for the client and then sent the email out to specific employees that the client selected.
					<ul>
						<li>Performed all different kinds of testing and learned tricks regarding how to exploit a company's network.</li>
						<li>Wrote reports on findings to give the client background on what process was taken.</li>
					</ul>
